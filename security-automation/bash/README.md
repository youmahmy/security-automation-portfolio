## Projects
### YouWatch Falco Auto-Quarantine System

YouWatch Auto-Quarantine is a Bash-based security response script that monitors Falco runtime security alerts and automatically isolates compromised workloads in Kubernetes.
The script is designed to reflect how rapid containment can be achieved using existing Kubernetes and ingress primitives without complex tooling.

## Future Bash Automation

This directory is structured to support additional Bash-based security tooling, including:
- Node and workload isolation scripts
- Emergency response playbooks
- Cluster hygiene and validation checks
- Runtime visibility helpers for security operations
