# Python Security Automation

This directory contains Python-based security automation projects focused on real-time detection, decision-making, and response within cloud-native environments.

Python is used here for its ability to handle structured data, concurrency, and integration with external systems, making it well-suited for advanced security orchestration and control logic.

## Future Python Automation

This directory is intended to grow with additional Python-based security automation, including:
- SOAR-style response workflows
- Detection correlation engines
- Security telemetry enrichment pipelines
- Kubernetes security controllers and operators
