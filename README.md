# Introduction
This portfolio showcases practical, offensive, and defensive security engineering projects focused on increasing operational efficiency, reducing organisational risk and hardening environments.

My work emphasises the strategic application of automation to critical security domains, including:

### Zero Trust Architecture *(ZTNA)*
Implementing of precise network segmentation and access control policies *(Calico Network Policies, NGINX IP Whitelisting)* within Kubernetes and Linux environments.

### DevSecOps & Runtime Security 
Building detection and monitoring pipelines *(Falco IDS automation)* to ensure realtime visibility into container and host activity.

### Security Operations and DLP 
Developing custom PowerShell scripts *(YouCheck, YouFile, Redactor)* to automate local security auditing, file integrity monitoring *(FIM)*, and data loss prevention *(DLP)* tasks on Windows endpoints.

### Vulnerability Management 
Integrating tools like Trivy for automated container image analysis and risk assessment.

All projects demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the security lifecycle, from infrastructure deployment and policy enforcement, to continuous monitoring and troubleshooting complex networking challenges.
